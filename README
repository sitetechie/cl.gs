NAME
    cl.gs - Redis-based URL Shortener

VERSION
    0.001

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer;
        use clgs;
        dance;

DESCRIPTION
    cl.gs is a small URL Shortener built on top of Redis and the Dancer
    framework.

    A word of caution: don't use this for anything other than a private
    installation for personal use. Any publicly accessible URL shortener
    should take proper security and anti-spam measures to prevent
    shortlinking to malware sites, such as bot blocking captcha's, blacklist
    checks, rate limiting, webcrawler policies, short url decoding
    capabilities, etc.

  Routes
    GET /
        Show form to encode a long url.

    POST /
        Encode a long url and show the results.

    GET /:short_code
        Redirect to the long url for this short code.

    GET /:short_code+
        Show traffic statistics for this short code.

CONFIGURATION
    Configuration can be achieved via a config.yml file or via the set
    keyword. To use the config.yml approach, you will need to install YAML.
    See the Dancer documentation for more information.

    The only configurable setting is the cookie name, which defaults to
    '__clgs'.

    Example config.yml:

        # Dancer specific config settings
        logger: file
        log: errors

        clgs:
            cookie: c3RhbXBzMQ

    You can alternatively configure the server via the 'set' keyword in the
    source code. This approach does not require a config file.

        use Dancer;
        use clgs;

        # Dancer specific config settings
        set logger      => 'file';
        set log         => 'debug';
        set show_errors => 1;

        set clgs => {
            cookie => 'c3RhbXBzMQ',
        };

        dance;

DEPLOYMENT
    Deployment is very flexible. It can be run on a web server via CGI or
    FastCGI. It can also be run on any Plack web server. See
    Dancer::Deployment for more details.

  FastCGI
    cl.gs can be run via FastCGI. This requires that you have the FCGI and
    Plack modules installed. Here is an example FastCGI script. It assumes
    your cl.gs server is in the file clgs.pl.

        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use Dancer ':syntax';
        use Plack::Handler::FCGI;

        my $app = do "/path/to/clgs.pl";
        my $server = Plack::Handler::FCGI->new(nproc => 5, detach => 1);
        $server->run($app);

    Here is an example lighttpd config. It assumes you named the above file
    clgs.fcgi.

        fastcgi.server += (
            "/" => ((
                "socket" => "/tmp/fcgi.sock",
                "check-local" => "disable",
                "bin-path" => "/path/to/clgs.fcgi",
            )),
        )

    Now cl.gs will be running via FastCGI under /.

  Plack
    cl.gs can be run with any Plack web server. Just run:

        plackup clgs.pl

    You can change the Plack web server via the -s option to plackup.
